    CONSOLE APPLICATION : 03_file Project Overview
========================================================================

Simple demo project to show how to work with file objects.
This project has only one thread (main thread).
It demonstrates how to create text and binary files, how to reserve a size of the file, how to copy files and how to resolve file paths.
It uses relative paths and file names with a special mask like %time% (set timestamp) or %appname% (the name of the process).
In AREG framework file objects are defined as a streaming object, so that the streaming operators can be as well used.
