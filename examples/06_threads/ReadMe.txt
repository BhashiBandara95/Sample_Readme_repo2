    CONSOLE APPLICATION : 06_thread Project Overview
========================================================================

This project demonstrates how to create simple and dispatcher threads and how the overrides to use to change the business logic of the thread.
All threads have an entry point onThreadRuns() that is triggered when thread runs.
The dispatcher threads in addition can use runDispatcher() or dispatchEvent() to overwrite the event processing logic.
