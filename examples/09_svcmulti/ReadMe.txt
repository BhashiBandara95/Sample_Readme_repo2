    CONSOLE APPLICATION : 09_svcmulti Project Overview
========================================================================

This project demonstrates how to instantiate multiple instances of the 
same service differing by names. It is an extension of 08_service, uses 
empty services and instantiates 2 identical services with different names.

The same local service can be instantiate more than once if instances
differ by name and run in different threads.
